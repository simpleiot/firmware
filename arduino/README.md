# Simple IoT Arduino Serial Device Example

This project includes an example of using an Arduino board as a Simple IoT
serial I/O device, where the Arduino board is connected via USB to a computer
running Simple IoT. Arduino IOs are display in the SIOT user interface and can
be observed/controlled. Data can also be logged to InfluxDB and graphed in the
InfluxDB web UI or Grafana if desired, as well as sent upstream to a cloud
instance of Simple IoT.
